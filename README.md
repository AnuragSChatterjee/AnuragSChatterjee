‚Ä¢ üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @AnuragSChatterjee, National University Of Singapore (NUS) Undergraduate pursuing Electrical Engineering with a double major in Innovation And Design, Ridge View Residential College Programme (RVRC) on Interdisplinary Studies involving sustainability studies and leadership, and specializing in the Internet Of Things (IoT). 

‚Ä¢ My main purpose of my GitHub page is to document all the mini-projects that I do during my free time to learn new things, as well as my intenship experiences. 

‚Ä¢ I have done a bit of leetcode practice in 3 different programming languages i.e. Python, C and C++ for easy questions just to get started, and you can check them out in one of my repositories. 

‚Ä¢ üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Electronics And IoT Engineering, Robotics, Product/Project Management In Tech Startups, Memes Design, Blogging And Entrepreneurship!

‚Ä¢ üíº I have prior educational and professional work experience in the following areas of expertise from my experience working in academia as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Design Thinking in the National University Of Singapore (NUS), then in technical and business roles within deep tech & engineering startups based out of Singapore, university engineering teams, and lastly, in Global Fortune 500 MNCs based in Europe and USA:

        ‚ñ° Electronics Design Engineering: Arduino Programming, MATLAB, EAGLE-CAD, Autodesk CAD, PCB Design, LTSpice Circuit Design and Simulations, CircuitLab For Electronic Component Design, Power Electronics Calculations, Hardware Serial Communication, GUI, Electronics Testing & Manufacturing 

        ‚ñ° Software & Hardware Engineering: IoT Programming Languages (C, C++ & Python), Flask, MySQL, SQL, Raspberry Pi Programming, WeMosD1 Microcontrollers Programming, Hardware-Software Interfacing and Integration,  FPGA Programming, EDA Tools, TCP/IP Computer Networks, Python Socket Programming, Client-Server Programming

        ‚ñ° Innovation Design Engineering: Figma, Design Thinking Methodologies (Value Proposition Canvas, Feasibility & Dot Matrix, HMW Problem Statements, UX Research, Personas  Mapping, Rapid Prototyping, Conceptualization), Product & Project Management, Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator, Miro Tools


‚Ä¢ üìñ Self-taught myself the following technical skills in coding/programming through online courses from Udemy, Coursera, Coursera Project Network and LinkedIn Learning:

        ‚ñ° Python 
        ‚ñ° Machine Learning
        ‚ñ° Data Science: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn
        ‚ñ° SQL
        ‚ñ° C (Through Leetcode Practice And Readings There)
        ‚ñ° C++ (Through Leetcode Practice And Readings There)

‚Ä¢ üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Coding through beginner projects from online courses (C, Python & Machine Learning), Electronics Design Engineering (PCB, EAGLE CAD, Arduino, MATLAB, LT Spice Circuit Simulations)!

‚Ä¢ I have documented all my tech learning journey here, self-taught myself various coding languages (Python,C,SQL) and did up ML & Data Analysis projects. Link here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zWLbUNbxT9Qml-xY7RNeMWwGoudCwadg

‚Ä¢ üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on various open source tech and engineering projects! Currently documenting my work in basic tech projects here to level up my digital skills
